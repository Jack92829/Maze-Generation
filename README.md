# Maze-Generation
This uses the depth-first search algorithm of maze generation implemented with recursive backtracking

The algorithm was used in a variety of ways, including as a visualisation, an image generator and an ASCII-maze generator

Note: The ASCII-maze generator is not suitable for displaying large mazes due to text wrap

Note: A JavaScript version of the ASCII-maze generation can be found as well
